Project on music genre classification for Machine Learning; Basic Principles (Aalto University, 2017)
Authors: Tinka Valentijn, Zhang Guangyi

Classification on music genre has been unprecedentedly successful aided with machine learning techniques recently. However, it remains a real challenge to choose a proper method among various learning approaches since genre classification poses three major difficulties, consisting of imbalance, subjectivity and high dimension. This paper reviews mainstream learning methods on this classification task and summarizes their advantages and disadvantages when coping with the difficulties. The methods that have been investigated include linear and non-linear classifiers, dimensionality reduction techniques, and ensemble models. Comparison is drawn based on their accuracy, efficiency, robustness and interpretability. We come to the conclusion that of the tested methods the Support Vector Machine gives the best performance with an accuracy of 65.39%.
